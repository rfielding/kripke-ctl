# kripke-ctl Documentation

This `docs/` tree is intended to grow into a short book:

- why modal logic and Kripke models matter for everyday reasoning
- how to model business-y systems as communicating state machines
- how to express requirements as CTL formulas
- how to generate diagrams and charts automatically from models

For now there is just a single example model: the **PURPLE** cipher keyspace
collapse story.

See:

- `docs/models/purple.md` – model description + diagrams
